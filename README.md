## Our Website:
The RedDack Daily is a site that displays updated news tracked by location. Searching by location, the user can find news articles from that location from multiple sources, such as the Guardian and the New York Times. Put together with the overall News API as well as a Holiday API, the website pulls information from these sources every time a location is searched that has not already been searched in the last 24 hours. Users are also able to save articles in order to view them over. We hope the RedDack Daily keeps you informed and impressed :)

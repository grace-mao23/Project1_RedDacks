Team Response to "Egoless Programming"
This text was so enlightening and big brain. We'd like to think that
each person in our group has a good balance of those three major types
of personalities, but we can only dream. Instead, we will focus on
communicating with each other and really working hard to bring the
entire project together. We will...
   1. Forget the word I. There's no I. Only we. No my, just our. Our
website. Our project. We made progress. Mr. Mykolyk, we think...
   2. Use comms as liberally as the QAF and let each other know when we
mess up or succeed or just need help (sighs)
   3. Stop thinking of programming as some solitary action. Class time
is the perfect time to code collaboratively.
